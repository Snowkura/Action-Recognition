This is an RGB camera-based action recognition system that allows autonomous wheelchairs to understand instructions from traffic guards.
This system locate traffic guards by using YOLOv5 to identify traffic batons, and then utilize OpenPose to obtain human body 2D key points in real time to classify his/her action.
